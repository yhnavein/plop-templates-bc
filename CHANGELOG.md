# Custom Plop Templates

## v 1.1.1

- [Fix] Fixed `spec.ts` template to adjust to the new way of initializing unit tests in code

## v 1.1.0

- [Breaking Changes] Changed way the files are structured in the dependent projects.

Now it's assumed that page components reside in `src/app/domain/` directory. Previously it was `src/app/` directly.

This way the project is better organized.

## v 1.0.3

- Initial plop templates configuration.
